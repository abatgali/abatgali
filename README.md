  <p>My name is Anant Batgali, a senior at IUPUI pursuing a BS in Informatics expected to graduate by the end of 2024.</p>
  <p>I currently hold a certificate in Multi-Device Web development from IUPUI and am trying to indie-hack my way to success! Currently working on building a chatbot(classic OpenAI wrapper app ik but better to have my own than anyone else's to place on my business front - vvault.us *loading*)</p>
  <p>Outside of sitting in front of a desk, I also obsess over credit card points and redeeming them for travel. I might start a blog to post my referral links...</p>
